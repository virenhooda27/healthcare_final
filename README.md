<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  About The Project

  

Dr.Symptoms is a sophisticated healthcare application designed for accurate disease prediction and management using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Built on cutting-edge technologies, this platform leverages a VGG model transfer for image classification, allowing users to upload images of specific body parts to predict diseases with high accuracy.

  

The frontend of Dr.Symptoms is developed using React JS, providing a modern and responsive user interface styled with Tailwind CSS. This ensures an intuitive user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

  

On the backend, Flask is used to handle server-side logic and API endpoints. Data management is facilitated by Supabase, offering a secure and scalable database solution. This setup ensures robust data handling, authentication, and real-time updates for user interactions.
